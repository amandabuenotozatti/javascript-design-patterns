## Project Overview

The project of this course will be to build a register of stock exchange negotiations. We will register new deals and they will be imported from specialized services, all applying the functional and object-oriented paradigms while, at the same time, using the best of both worlds.

At first glance, the scope of our application may seem quite reduced, but it is enough to apply new features of the JavaScript language, or ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), technically speaking. In addition, we will organize our code in the MVC model (Model-View-Controller), apply design patterns, program asynchronously with *promises, render templates, and work with proxies, among other things.

First we use document.querySelector which is a Dom API that allows us to fetch a DOM element using a CSS selector.
